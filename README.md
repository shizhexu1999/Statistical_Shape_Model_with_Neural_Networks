## **Statistical Shape Model with Neural Networks**
**********************************************

## Summary

This repository contains the code for the traditional Statistical Shape Model (SSM), FlowSSM, and a modified SSM incorporating the occupancy probability model.

We propose a novel SSM by adding neural network encoder/decoder and latent representation instead of using point distribution models. The new model can measure average surface distance and chamfer distance, and reconstruct shapes without dense correspondence between training samples
